Creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a beginner e-commerce website with a React.js front end and a Java Spring Boot back end is an important step in the software development process. The SRS document outlines the system's functionalities, requirements, and constraints. Below, I'll provide you with a simplified SRS template for your e-commerce project. Please keep in mind that a complete SRS would typically be more detailed and comprehensive, tailored to your specific project's needs.
